Decade-long burning question (for me, at least). Why does every single TV show name the very first episode "Pilot"? Who started doing this? 

Anyway, welcome to my Pilot episode. My very first post in a personal website that I finally got around to. Sometimes I like writing, sometimes I do not. I don't think I'm great at grammar, but I'm honest and genuine in what I write.
So, since this website will be featured on my Resume and whatnot, and since school is such a big part of my life now, I guess I will focus on writing academic articles. But expect other articles like my interest in vlogging, tennis, random thoughts, "Day in a Life".......

Hope you enjoy!
